                <p>One month ago, I tested a virtual reality headset called the HTC Vive Pre. The Pre was a
                    development
                    kit created by gaming behemoth Valve and smartphone maker HTC, and it was one of the most
                    exciting
                    new pieces of hardware I’ve had the pleasure of writing about — a device that offered full-body,
                    room-scale VR.</p>

                <h4>Consumer release</h4>

                <p>The headset above is not the Vive Pre. It’s the final consumer edition Vive that’s coming out
                    today,
                    although it looks almost identical — the branding is new, and the small focus rod on the bottom
                    is
                    ridged instead of smooth, but I still sometimes worry I’m picking up the wrong set by accident.
                    What’s changed is the context. The Pre was an obviously unfinished device that never went on
                    sale,
                    complete with software glitches and half-finished games. The Vive is a real piece of consumer
                    hardware that you can go online and pay $800 for right this minute. It’s coming out a week after
                    the
                    Oculus Rift, a competing headset with impeccable polish but limited ambition. So expectations
                    for
                    the Vive are high — and the headset both exceeds and falls short of them.</p>

                    <h4>Roomscale VR</h4>

                    <p>Since its first prototype was announced in early 2015, the Vive has been very clearly a full VR
                        system, not just a headset. Besides its heavy black goggles, the system includes a pair of
                        wireless
                        motion controllers shaped like cupholders on sticks, and two "lighthouse" towers that are placed
                        at
                        opposite corners of a room, shooting fields of lasers for motion tracking. The Vive grew out of
                        a
                        prototype at Valve, and while the remotes don’t look much like gaming hardware, they’re designed
                        like a slimmed-down, split-up version of the company’s more traditional Steam Controller. Each
                        one
                        has a clicky front trigger, a pair of side bumpers that you can press by squeezing tightly, two
                        top
                        buttons, and a smooth trackpad.</p>

                    <h4>The controllers</h4>

                    <p>The Steam Controller’s trackpad was originally meant to give PC gamers mouse-like precision on a
                        console-style controller, but on the Vive controllers, it could easily be replaced by an
                        ordinary
                        d-pad for most of the experiences I’ve tried. The best argument for it is aesthetic: it’s the
                        trackpad that elevates the Vive controller design from fancy Wii Remote to something truly
                        futuristic; each pad a beautiful little circle that looks like a cyberpunk data chip or a pan of
                        expensive eyeshadow. And adding an interface element that’s foreign to almost everyone is a
                        great
                        signal that the Vive isn’t just for people who know their way around a controller.</p>
